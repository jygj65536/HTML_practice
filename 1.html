<h1>Why Atom?</h1>
<p>There are a lot of text editors out there; why should you spend your time learning about and using Atom?</p>
We think we can do better. Our goal is a zero-compromise combination of hackability and usability: an editor that will be welcoming to an elementary school student on their first day learning to code, but also a tool they won't outgrow as they develop into seasoned hackers.<br>
As we've used Atom to build Atom, what began as an experiment has gradually matured into a tool we can't live without. On the surface, Atom is the modern desktop text editor you've come to expect. Pop the hood, however, and you'll discover a system begging to be hacked on.<br>
